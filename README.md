<h1>CSV Formatter App</h1>

This is a <b>Node.js</b> application that allows the end user to enter into a text-area input a CSV string delimited by 
carriage returns(e.g. <b>\r\n</b> or <b>\n</b>), and returns a formatted CSV string where each header in the header row and 
each corresponding data field in each data field row wrapped in square brackets(e.g. <b>[]</b>) rather than double quotes, which is then 
rendered to a Vue.js front end.
